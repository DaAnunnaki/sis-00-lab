/*
 * (Anagram.java) Two strings are anagrams if they are written using the same exact letters. Write a method anagram(String s1, String s2) to check if given two strings are anagrams or not. You have to ignore the case and space characters. Write a test program for that prompts the user to input two strings and invokes this method. Some example runs are:
Enter the first string: abbacba
Enter the second string: abcabba
abbacba and abcabba are anagrams
Enter the first string: banana
Enter the second string: cabana
banana and cabana are NOT anagrams
Enter the first string: Eleven plus two
Enter the second string: Twelve plus one
Eleven plus two and Twelve plus one are anagrams
